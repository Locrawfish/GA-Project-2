#This app is for my second project as a WDI student at General Assembly

This app aims to allow users to select ingredients they have available, and
see potential recipes they can create from those ingredients. This version of
the app will also allow users to have individual
accounts to save favorited recipes.

This app is particularly salient given the increased food waste we face
and the climate implications of that waste. It also will allow users to
save money; it is estimated food waste cost Americans $161.6 billion in 2010.
